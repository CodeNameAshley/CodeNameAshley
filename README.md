## 🌼 About Me  
Hi, I’m Ashley!  
- I write code (sometimes messy, always with love 🌸).  
- Originally a law school graduate ⚖️ → now a developer 💻.  
- Currently finishing my Computer Science degree.  
- Big fan of RuneScape, cozy games, and building projects that bring people together.

## 💜 On-going Projects  
🌷 **Night At The Museum** – A trial horror game made with Godot + Aseprite. Inspired by *Observation Duty* gameplay mechanics.  

🌷 **Clan Rune Metrics** – A web app that tracks and visualises activity for RuneScape 3 clans.  

- **Purpose**: Built to give clans better visibility on member performance and contributions beyond what the official RuneScape tools provide.  
- **Frontend**: Developed with **React**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**, using a dashboard-like interface for clarity and ease of use.  
- **Backend/Hosting**: Hosted on **Render**, with environment-based configuration to securely manage API keys and clan data.  
- **Features**:  
  - Real-time RuneMetrics integration to pull player XP gains, boss kills, and activity logs.  
  - **Per-user logic** that reduces redundant API polling by checking recent activity before fetching new data.  
  - Clean, responsive UI that presents clan-wide summaries and individual player breakdowns.  
  - Future expansion includes notifications, automated event tracking, and historical performance graphs.  
- **Why it matters**: Helps clan leaders and members see growth patterns, reward activity, and organise events with reliable data.

## 💜 Finished Projects: 

🌷 **Foodle** – A recipe discovery app that helps you cook with what’s already in your fridge.  
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, React, SASS, CSS, Bootstrap, Firebase Auth. Uses Axios to fetch recipes from the Spoonacular API and processes results into a clean UI.  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js. Stores “liked” recipes in a custom API for retrieval and profile display.
