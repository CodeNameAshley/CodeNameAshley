- ðŸŒ¼ About Me: I write shitty code when they let me, originally a law school graduate but career switched to being a dev, currently finishing a computer science degree.

<br /> 

## ðŸ’œ On-going Projects: 
ðŸŒ·**Game X**: I am currently creating a 2d pixel art game, using godot as the game engine, and aseprite for the artwork and animation. The theme is similar to cosy games found online. Will be released on Steam only
- **Game Y**: This is a trial game I'm making using godot and aseprite, it's mechanics and game play is similar to observation duty.

ðŸŒ·**Foodle**: A recipe based application that utilises the ingredients in your fridge or pantry to produce recipes using the searched ingredients.
- **Foodle Front-end**: This is the front-end of foodle which uses JavaScript, React, SASS, CSS, and some Bootstrap. The search functionality uses Axios to retrieve recipes from a third-party API (spoonacular), the data is processed through different JS functions to output them in a user friendly manner. The project also uses Firebase authentication to allow users to log-in and potentially like recipes. Profile route is protected and is only accessible once user is authenticated and logged in. 
- **Foodle Back-end**: This project utilises JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js to create an API for foodle. This API will enable all recipe data to be stored once a user likes a recipe, and can be retrieved and shown in a profile using useEffect and Axios request. This will allow the app to store data in a separate API, instead of getting the liked recipe data from spoonacular.

ðŸŒ·**Clan Rune Metrics**: Runescape metrics for a clan, written in js, react, and css
